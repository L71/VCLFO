VCLFO
=====

This is an LFO/oscillator with voltage control (uses LED+LDR circuit for F control).
Built-in attenuverter for frequency CV input. Outputs for triangle/saw + square wave. Three frequency ranges, sloooow to mid audio range.

Version 2 works better, it has exponential frequency response (don't expect it to be linear or precise, though!) and the LED will work corectly when in ramp output mode. 
The trimmer pot on the V. 2 can be used to tune the LFO rate ranges. The correct setting should be when it's at about 5-6 kOhm (the exponential converter output should just about reach the maximum negative voltage when the rate pot is at maximum).
